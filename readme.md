# Paper Reading Records

This repository is used to store notes taken while reading papers. 
As part of personal practice, the papers I read may cover different fields, but I mainly focus on groundbreaking papers in deep learning.

## Deep Learning

Note for those breakthrough model and technology. Folder `ModelRealize` stores all the code for models I have successfully replicated from papers.

### CNN

1. [Note](./CNN/AlexNet.md) for AlexNet [ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2999134.2999257). Code to replicate model, written in Pytorch, stores [here](./ModelRealize/CNN/AlexNet/).
2. [Note](./CNN/VGG.md) for VGG [Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556). [Replicated model Code](./ModelRealize/CNN/VGG/)
3. [Note](./CNN/ResNet.md) for ResNet [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). [Replicated model Code](./ModelRealize/CNN/VGG/)
