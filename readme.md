# Paper Reading Records

This repository is used to store notes taken while reading papers. 
As part of personal practice, the papers I read may cover different fields, but I mainly focus on groundbreaking papers in deep learning.

## Deep Learning

Note for those breakthrough model and technology. Folder `ModelRealize` stores all the code for models I have successfully replicated from papers.

### CNN
